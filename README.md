# Dogatopia
Bringing PetFi to the metaverse by combining finance, community, and independently validated information through oracle integration.

DOGATOPIA is a revolutionary, Web3 project dedicated to advancing the health and life span of our beloved canine companions. Our community is bringing the power of blockchain technology to aggregate and validate critical information around dog care and companionship. Unlike other projects, Dogotopia is a truly decentralized, global community of dog lovers who are passionate about taking care and connection to the next level.
 
So, get ready - Dogatopia is about to unleash a dog lover's platform that is unlike anything you've seen before!
​
The heart of our project is Dogapedia - the world’s first free, comprehensive informational resource that is 100% community owned and curated by dog experts. As members of the Dogatopia community, your experience matters! Members share first-hand about what they do with their dogs, what they need, what works, what doesn't, and so much more. This data is then objectively curated by our community of experts so that all dog lovers have easy, free access to the best insights and shared community experiences needed to take dog care to the next level. Dogapedia is where the searchability of Google meets the informational resource of Wikipedia.
​
But Dogapedia is only one part of what makes Dogatopia heavenly. This is a comprehensive place for dog lovers where you can learn more, care better, connect more deeply with other dog lovers AND GET REWARDED FOR DOING SO!
